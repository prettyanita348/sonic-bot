- **Claim Box**: Automates the process of claiming rewards boxes.
- **Open Box**: Automates the process of opening mystery boxes.
- **Daily Login**: Automates the daily login process.
- **Input Methods**: Supports input via seed phrases or private keys.
- **Random Address Generation**: Generates a specified number of random addresses for sending transactions.
- **Adjustable Amount of SOL**: Allows users to specify the amount of SOL to send in each transaction.
- **Transaction Delay**: Allows users to specify a delay between each transaction.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- `npm` or `yarn` package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prettyanita348/sonic-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sonic-bot
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Prepare input files:

   - Create `accounts.json` with an array of seed phrases.
   - Create `privateKeys.json` with an array of private keys (base58 encoded).

   Example `accounts.json`:
   ```json
   [
     "seed_phrase_1",
     "seed_phrase_2"
   ]
   ```

   Example `privateKeys.json`:
   ```json
   [
     "base58_private_key_1",
     "base58_private_key_2"
   ]
   ```

## Usage

Run the bot using Node.js:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run claim
```


Run the Script:

1. When running the script, the user will be prompted to choose between using predefined addresses or generating random
ones. Afterward, the transfer process will proceed as specified.
2. Predefined Addresses File:

Create a predefinedAddresses.json file with an array of addresses, for example:
json
Copy code
[
  "YourAddress1Here",
  "YourAddress2Here",
  ...
]
## Generating random Addresses Enter the amount of SOL to send in each transaction.
3. Enter the delay between each transaction in milliseconds (default is 1000ms).
4. Workflow:
User selects the network (devnet or testnet).
User chooses the action (dailyClaim, dailyLogin, or mysteryBox opening).
The script executes the action across all private keys.
After completion, the user can either perform another action or exit.

## Key Insights:
The bot is useful for automating tasks related to the Sonic game on the Solana network, 
including managing mystery box rewards and daily check-ins.
Extensive use of Solana blockchain functionalities, like signing transactions and sending them over the network.
The program includes robust error handling to ensure smooth execution, even in the face of network or API failures.
This script would be suitable for someone managing multiple Solana accounts to automate their game-related activities.
It also integrates with the game's testnet based on the selected network.
